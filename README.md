🧮 Python Calculator
A fully functional command-line calculator built with Python. This program allows users to perform<br> basic arithmetic operations and continue calculating with the result of the previous operation.<br>

📝 Description<br>
This project is a text-based calculator that replicates the logic of a real calculator.<br> It takes user inputs for numbers and mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) and returns the result.<br>

I built this project to master:<br>

Python Functions (defining and calling functions).<br>

Dictionaries (mapping operators to functions).<br>

While Loops & Recursion (allowing continuous calculations).<br>

Type Conversion (handling integers and floats).<br>

⚡ Features<br>
Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.<br>

Continuous Calculation: You can take the result of one calculation and immediately use it for the next.<br>

Fresh Start: Option to clear the screen and start a brand new calculation without restarting the program.<br>

Error Prevention: Handles basic input logic.<br>

🎮 How to Use
Run the script in your terminal.<br>

Enter the first number.<br>

Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).<br>

Enter the second number.<br>

The result will be displayed.<br>

Type y to continue calculating with the result, n to start a new calculation, or exit.<br>
